- Call Coroner and Towtrucks to get rid of dead bodies resp. seized cars
- Departments: LSPD, BCSO, SASP (State Patrol), SAPR (Park Ranger), SWAT
- Basic working armory, wardrobe, garage
- Work as a towtruck driver for the DPOS (Department of Public Order and Safety; very limited script-support)
- Custom TP-script to quickly get you to each police-station
